    <p >What was injustice we faced as kids?Not getting what we want,for one.Or an elder sibling getting something that we couldn't have.Or getting punished for something we did that we felt was rightly justified.</p>
    <p >But as we grow up, we realise that life isn't fair in many other areas as well.It could be unfairness in terms of what we have experienced,or what we posses or maybe our status in society.It could be so many things.</p>
    <p >It could be the fact that while so manyothers are blessed with physical attractiveness,you were born with below average looks. It could be the fact that you're always only second best.It could be the fact that you're never the first choice.It could be anything.Life is unfair</p>
    <p >But at the end of the day,life is unfair.And at most times,all you can do is sit back and endure it.Grit your teeth and clench your fists as you feature in your own story of injustice.Because there's nothing you can do about it.</p>
    <p >Life is unfair.So what?Get over it</p>
