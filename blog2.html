    <p >“It’s impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all, in which case you have failed by default.” – J.K. Rowling

    </p>
    <p >To put in simpler words, failure is inevitable. Therefore, one must not be afraid of them. Before Thomas Alva Edison invented the electric light bulb, he tried innumerable times. But, each of his attempts ‘burst’ into pieces. He did not give up, he kept on trying until he succeeded. On being asked how he felt about his failed attempts, Edison replied, “I have not failed. I just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.” The lesson to be learnt here is that success and failure go hand in hand. Until and unless we fail, we don’t become aware of our shortcomings.</p>
    <p >Many people do not realise that failure is really a stepping stone to success. Instead of having a positive outlook on failure and learning lessons from it, they only view the negative aspect of failure. Those who consider failure an opportunity to do better, never let it overwhelm themselves. Such people succeed in life (sooner or later) because they have faith in themselves. Such people may or may not be optimists, but when they resolve to overcome their weaknesses or shortcomings, their focus automatically shifts to the lessons they can learn from it.</p>
    <p> In conclusion, failure and setbacks are normal part of life. They make us understand where we can improve and encourage us to persist. It is the wise who takes advantage of their failures</p>
